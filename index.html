<p>In this major I have been able to have multiple experiences and contribute to many projects. I have attended multiple hackathons where I won various awards such as the UX/UI Design award, presented by Enterprise, at the Pickhacks Hackathon for a website I created and designed within a handful of hours.
    Currently, I am the group organizer for my team and I's Sr. design project. The University of Tennessee at Martin is soon going to offer a game development class and our group was presented the 
    opportunity to lay the groundwork for the class. We are creating multiple games to research how Unreal Engine works so that we can create documented tutorials so that the students will not have
    to struggle with the basic and intermediate tasks like we did in the beginning.
